## `Ref` Methods

`TrueSheet` has a couple of core methods that you'll be using most of the time. These methods are asynchronous so you can use `async` and `await` on them.

Define the sheet and provide a `ref`. We will be using the `sheet` to access these methods.
```tsx {4}
const sheet = useRef<TrueSheet>(null)

return (
  <TrueSheet ref={sheet} sizes={['auto', '80%']}>
    <View />
  </TrueSheet>
)
```

### `present`

Present the sheet. Optionally accepts a size `index`. See [`sizes`](/reference/props#sizes) prop.

| Parameters | Required |
| - | - |
| `index: number = 0` | No |

```tsx
await sheet.current?.present()
```


### `dismiss`

Dismisses the sheet.

```tsx
await sheet.current?.dismiss()
```

### `resize`

Resizes the sheet programmatically by `index`. This is an alias of the [`present(index)`](#present) method.

| Parameters | Required |
| - | - |
| `index: number` | Yes

```tsx
// Resize to 80%
await sheet.current?.resize(1)
```

## Global Methods

You can also call the above methods statically without having access to a sheet's `ref`. This is particularly useful when you want to present a sheet from anywhere.

The API is similar to the `ref` methods except for the required [`name`](/reference/props#name) prop. See [this guide](/guides/global-methods) for example.

In the example below, we provide `"my-sheet"` as the `name` of our sheet.
```tsx {4}
const sheet = useRef<TrueSheet>(null)

return (
  <TrueSheet name="my-sheet" sizes={['auto', '80%']}>
    <View />
  </TrueSheet>
)
```

You can then use these methods globally.

```tsx
await TrueSheet.present('my-sheet')
```
```tsx
await TrueSheet.dismiss('my-sheet')
```
```tsx
// Resize to 80%
await TrueSheet.resize('my-sheet', 1)
```
