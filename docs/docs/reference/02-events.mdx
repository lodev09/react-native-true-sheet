Lifecycle events available for `TrueSheet`.

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const handleDismiss = () => {
    console.log('Bye bye')
  }

  const handleOnWillPresent = (e: WillPresentEvent) => {
    console.log(e.nativeEvent) // { index: 0, position: 123.5, detent: 0.5 }
    console.log('Sheet is about to be presented')
  }

  const handleOnDidPresent = (e: DidPresentEvent) => {
    console.log(e.nativeEvent) // { index: 0, position: 123.5, detent: 0.5 }
  }

  const handleDetentChange = (e: DetentChangeEvent) => {
    console.log(e.nativeEvent) // { index: 1, position: 234.5, detent: 0.8 }
  }

  return (
    <View>
      <Button title="Present" onPress={() => sheet.current?.present()} />
      <TrueSheet
        ref={sheet}
        detents={[0.5, 0.8]}
        onWillPresent={handleOnWillPresent}
        onDidPresent={handleOnDidPresent}
        onDetentChange={handleDetentChange}
        onWillDismiss={handleOnWillDismiss}
        onDidDismiss={handleOnDidDismiss}
      >
        <Button title="Resize" onPress={() => sheet.current?.resize(1)} />
        <Button title="Dismiss" onPress={() => sheet.current?.dismiss(1)} />
      </TrueSheet>
    </View>
  )
}
```

## `onMount`

Called when the sheet's content is mounted and ready.
The sheet automatically waits for this event before presenting.

## `onWillPresent`

Comes with [`DetentInfoEventPayload`](/reference/types#detentinfoeventpayload).

This is called when the sheet is about to be presented.

## `onDidPresent`

Comes with [`DetentInfoEventPayload`](/reference/types#detentinfoeventpayload).

This is called when the sheet has been presented, providing the detent `index` and `position`.

## `onWillDismiss`

This is called when the sheet is about to be dismissed.

## `onDidDismiss`

This is called when the sheet has been dismissed.

## `onDetentChange`

Comes with [`DetentInfoEventPayload`](/reference/types#detentinfoeventpayload).

This is called when the detent of the sheet has changed, either by dragging or by programmatically [resizing](/reference/methods#resize) it.

## `onDragBegin`

Comes with [`DetentInfoEventPayload`](/reference/types#detentinfoeventpayload).

This is called when the sheet has began dragging.

## `onDragChange`

Comes with [`DetentInfoEventPayload`](/reference/types#detentinfoeventpayload).

This is called when the sheet is being dragged.

## `onDragEnd`

Comes with [`DetentInfoEventPayload`](/reference/types#detentinfoeventpayload).

This is called when the sheet dragging has ended.

## `onPositionChange`

Comes with [`PositionChangeEventPayload`](/reference/types#positionchangeeventpayload).

This is called continuously when the sheet's position changes during drag operations or transitions. This event fires more frequently than `onDragChange` and provides real-time position updates.

The `realtime` property indicates whether the position value is real-time (e.g., during drag or animation tracking). When `realtime` is `false`, the position should be animated in JS (ReanimatedTrueSheet handles this automatically).

:::tip
Use this event when you need smooth, continuous position tracking for animations or visual feedback. For less frequent updates during dragging, use `onDragChange` instead.
:::

## `onWillFocus`

This is called when the sheet is about to gain focus. This happens:
- When the sheet is being presented (along with `onWillPresent`)
- When another sheet presented on top of it begins dismissing

## `onDidFocus`

This is called when the sheet has gained focus. This happens:
- When the sheet has been presented (along with `onDidPresent`)
- When another sheet presented on top of it is dismissed

Useful for refreshing data or re-enabling interactions.

## `onWillBlur`

This is called when the sheet is about to lose focus. This happens:
- When the sheet is being dismissed (along with `onWillDismiss`)
- When another sheet is about to be presented on top of it

## `onDidBlur`

This is called when the sheet has lost focus. This happens:
- When the sheet has been dismissed (along with `onDidDismiss`)
- When another sheet is presented on top of it

Useful for pausing updates or disabling interactions.

## `onBackPress`

:::info Android only
:::

This is called when the hardware back button is pressed on Android. Use this to handle custom back press behavior, such as dismissing the sheet programmatically when `dismissible` is `false`.
