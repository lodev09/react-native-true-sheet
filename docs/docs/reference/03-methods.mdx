## Component Methods

`TrueSheet` has a couple of core methods that you'll be using most of the time. These methods are asynchronous so you can use `async` and `await` on them.

Define the sheet and provide a `ref`. We will be using the `sheet` to access these methods.
```tsx {4}
const sheet = useRef<TrueSheet>(null)

return (
  <TrueSheet ref={sheet} detents={['auto', 0.8]}>
    <View />
  </TrueSheet>
)
```

### `present`

Present the sheet. Optionally accepts a detent `index` and `animated` flag. See [`detents`](/reference/configuration#detents) prop.

| Parameters | Required | Default |
| - | - | - |
| `index: number` | No | `0` |
| `animated: boolean` | No | `true` |

```tsx
await sheet.current?.present()

// Present without animation
await sheet.current?.present(0, false)
```


### `dismiss`

Dismisses the sheet and all sheets presented on top of it in a single animation. Optionally accepts an `animated` flag.

| Parameters | Required | Default |
| - | - | - |
| `animated: boolean` | No | `true` |

```tsx
await sheet.current?.dismiss()

// Dismiss without animation
await sheet.current?.dismiss(false)
```

### `dismissStack`

Dismisses only the sheets presented on top of this sheet, keeping this sheet presented. If no sheets are presented on top, this method does nothing.

| Parameters | Required | Default |
| - | - | - |
| `animated: boolean` | No | `true` |

```tsx
await sheet.current?.dismissStack()

// Dismiss stack without animation
await sheet.current?.dismissStack(false)
```

This is useful when you want to close child sheets while keeping the current sheet open.

### `resize`

Resizes the sheet programmatically by `index`. The sheet must be presented before calling this method.

| Parameters | Required |
| - | - |
| `index: number` | Yes

```tsx
// Resize to 80%
await sheet.current?.resize(1)
```

## Global Methods

You can also call the above methods statically without having access to a sheet's `ref`. This is particularly useful when you want to present a sheet from anywhere.

The API is similar to the component methods except for the required [`name`](/reference/configuration#name) prop. See [this guide](/guides/global-methods) for example.

In the example below, we provide `"my-sheet"` as the `name` of our sheet.
```tsx {4}
const sheet = useRef<TrueSheet>(null)

return (
  <TrueSheet name="my-sheet" detents={['auto', 0.8]}>
    <View />
  </TrueSheet>
)
```

You can then use these methods globally.

```tsx
await TrueSheet.present('my-sheet')

// Present without animation
await TrueSheet.present('my-sheet', 0, false)
```
```tsx
await TrueSheet.dismiss('my-sheet')

// Dismiss without animation
await TrueSheet.dismiss('my-sheet', false)
```
```tsx
await TrueSheet.dismissStack('my-sheet')

// Dismiss stack without animation
await TrueSheet.dismissStack('my-sheet', false)
```

:::note
If no sheets are presented on top, `dismissStack()` does nothing.
:::

```tsx
// Resize to 80%
await TrueSheet.resize('my-sheet', 0.8)
```

### `dismissAll`

Dismisses all presented sheets in the current stack. This is useful when you need to close all sheets at once, for example when navigating away or resetting the UI state.

| Parameters | Required | Default |
| - | - | - |
| `animated: boolean` | No | `true` |

```tsx
await TrueSheet.dismissAll()

// Dismiss all without animation
await TrueSheet.dismissAll(false)
```

:::note
This only dismisses sheets in the current presentation context. Sheets presented behind a modal (e.g., React Navigation modal or React Native Modal) will not be affected.
:::

### Web

Static methods are not supported on web. Use the `useTrueSheet()` hook instead.

```tsx
import { useTrueSheet } from '@lodev09/react-native-true-sheet'

const { present, dismiss, dismissStack, resize, dismissAll } = useTrueSheet()

await present('my-sheet')
await dismiss('my-sheet')
await dismissAll()
```
