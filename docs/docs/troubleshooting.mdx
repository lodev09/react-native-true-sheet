# Troubleshooting

## Blank Screen When Dismissing React Native Modal on iOS

When presenting a TrueSheet on top of a React Native `<Modal>` and then dismissing the Modal (by setting `visible={false}`), the screen may go blank. This is a bug in React Native where dismissing a Modal that has another view controller presented on top of it only dismisses the topmost view controller, leaving the Modal in an inconsistent state.

**Workaround:**

Dismiss the sheet first before hiding the Modal:

```tsx
const sheet = useRef<TrueSheet>(null)
const [modalVisible, setModalVisible] = useState(false)

const closeModal = async () => {
  await sheet.current?.dismiss()
  setModalVisible(false)
}
```

:::info
A fix has been submitted to React Native. See [PR #55005](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/55005).

## Gesture Handler Not Working on Android

If you're using `react-native-gesture-handler` inside the sheet and gestures are not working on Android, you need to wrap your sheet content with `GestureHandlerRootView`.

```tsx
import { GestureHandlerRootView } from 'react-native-gesture-handler'

<TrueSheet>
  <GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>
    {/* Your content with gestures */}
  </GestureHandlerRootView>
</TrueSheet>
```

:::warning
Use `flexGrow: 1` instead of `flex: 1` to avoid layout issues.

[Learn more](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/fundamentals/installation#android) about gesture handler setup on Android.

## Weird layout render

The sheet does not have control over how React Native renders components and may lead to rendering issues. To resolve this, try to minimize the use of `flex=1` in your content styles. Instead, use fixed `height` or employ `flexGrow`, `flexBasis`, etc., to manage your layout requirements.

## Xcode and EAS Build Issues

### Xcode Version

The package requires **Xcode 26.1 or later**. Background functionality may not work correctly with older versions. Check your Xcode version:

```sh
xcodebuild -version
```

### EAS Build Configuration

When using [EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/), configure your `eas.json` to use a build image with Xcode 26.1+. Use `"image": "latest"` or choose from the [available build images](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/infrastructure/#ios-server-images):

```json
{
  "build": {
    "production": {
      "ios": {
        "image": "latest"
      }
    },
    "development": {
      "ios": {
        "image": "latest"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
