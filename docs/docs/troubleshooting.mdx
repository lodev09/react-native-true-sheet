# Troubleshooting

## React Native Gesture Handler

[`react-native-gesture-handler`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/)

On Android, [RNGH does not work](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/fundamentals/installation/#usage-with-modals-on-android) by default because modals are not located under React Native Root view in native hierarchy. To fix that, components need to be wrapped with `GestureHandlerRootView`.

```tsx
import { GestureHandlerRootView } from 'react-native-gesture-handler'
```

```tsx {3-5}
return (
  <TrueSheet ref={sheet}>
    <GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>
      <View />
    </GestureHandlerRootView>
  </TrueSheet>
)
```

:::info
Note that we are using `flexGrow` instead of `flex` here. For some weird reason, `flex` does not work correctly. See [below](#weird-layout-render).

## Touch Events Not Working on Android

On physical Android devices, touch events on buttons and pressables inside TrueSheet may not fire correctly. This appears to be a React Native Fabric limitation with modals.

Related: [#163](https://github.com/lodev09/react-native-true-sheet/issues/163), [#288](https://github.com/lodev09/react-native-true-sheet/issues/288)

**Workarounds:**

1. Use touchable components from [`react-native-gesture-handler`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/) instead of React Native's built-in components.

2. Set an explicit `width` on `GestureHandlerRootView` to fix first-render layout issues:

```tsx
import { useWindowDimensions } from 'react-native'
import { GestureHandlerRootView, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native-gesture-handler'

const { width } = useWindowDimensions()

return (
  <TrueSheet ref={sheet}>
    <GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flexGrow: 1, width }}>
      <TouchableOpacity onPress={handlePress}>
        {/* ... */}
      </TouchableOpacity>
    </GestureHandlerRootView>
  </TrueSheet>
)
```

## Keyboard Covering TextInput on Android with Unistyles

When using [`react-native-unistyles`](https://github.com/jpudysz/react-native-unistyles) alongside TrueSheet, the keyboard may cover the TextInput instead of the sheet repositioning itself. This is caused by Unistyles preventing TrueSheet from observing keyboard animation events on Android.

Related: [#354](https://github.com/lodev09/react-native-true-sheet/issues/354)

:::info
A fix has been submitted to Unistyles. See [PR #1061](https://github.com/jpudysz/react-native-unistyles/pull/1061).

## Blank Screen When Dismissing React Native Modal on iOS

When presenting a TrueSheet on top of a React Native `<Modal>` and then dismissing the Modal (by setting `visible={false}`), the screen may go blank. This is a bug in React Native where dismissing a Modal that has another view controller presented on top of it only dismisses the topmost view controller, leaving the Modal in an inconsistent state.

**Workaround:**

Dismiss the sheet first before hiding the Modal:

```tsx
const sheet = useRef<TrueSheet>(null)
const [modalVisible, setModalVisible] = useState(false)

const closeModal = async () => {
  await sheet.current?.dismiss()
  setModalVisible(false)
}
```

:::info
A fix has been submitted to React Native. See [PR #55005](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/55005).
:::

## Weird layout render

The sheet does not have control over how React Native renders components and may lead to rendering issues. To resolve this, try to minimize the use of `flex=1` in your content styles. Instead, use fixed `height` or employ `flexGrow`, `flexBasis`, etc., to manage your layout requirements.

## Build Failures with Xcode or EAS

If you encounter build failures when building your iOS app, it may be due to an incorrect Xcode version or EAS build configuration.

### Xcode Version

The package works better with **Xcode 26.2**. If you're building locally, check your Xcode version:

```sh
xcodebuild -version
```

If you're experiencing issues, we recommend updating to Xcode 26.2.

### EAS Build Configuration

When using [EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/), you must configure your `eas.json` to use a build image that includes Xcode 26.2 to build your app. Use `"image": "latest"` or choose from the [available build images](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/infrastructure/#ios-server-images):

```json
{
  "build": {
    "production": {
      "ios": {
        "image": "latest"
      }
    },
    "development": {
      "ios": {
        "image": "latest"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Without this configuration, EAS may use an older build image that doesn't include Xcode 26.2, causing build failures.
