# Troubleshooting

## React Native Gesture Handler

[`react-native-gesture-handler`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/)

On Android, [RNGH does not work](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/fundamentals/installation/#usage-with-modals-on-android) by default because modals are not located under React Native Root view in native hierarchy. To fix that, components need to be wrapped with `GestureHandlerRootView`.

```tsx
import { GestureHandlerRootView } from 'react-native-gesture-handler'
```

```tsx {3-5}
return (
  <TrueSheet ref={sheet}>
    <GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>
      <View />
    </GestureHandlerRootView>
  </TrueSheet>
)
```

:::info
Note that we are using `flexGrow` instead of `flex` here. For some weird reason, `flex` does not work correctly. See [below](#weird-layout-render).

## React Navigation

[`react-navigation`](https://reactnavigation.org)

See the [Navigation guide](/guides/navigation) for details on navigating to other screens from within a sheet.

## Weird layout render

The sheet does not have control over how React Native renders components and may lead to rendering issues. To resolve this, try to minimize the use of `flex=1` in your content styles. Instead, use fixed `height` or employ `flexGrow`, `flexBasis`, etc., to manage your layout requirements.
