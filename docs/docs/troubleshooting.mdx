# Troubleshooting

## React Native Gesture Handler

[`react-native-gesture-handler`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/)

On Android, [RNGH does not work](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/fundamentals/installation/#usage-with-modals-on-android) by default because modals are not located under React Native Root view in native hierarchy. To fix that, components need to be wrapped with `GestureHandlerRootView`.

```tsx
import { GestureHandlerRootView } from 'react-native-gesture-handler'
```

```tsx {3-5}
return (
  <TrueSheet ref={sheet}>
    <GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>
      <View />
    </GestureHandlerRootView>
  </TrueSheet>
)
```

:::info
Note that we are using `flexGrow` instead of `flex` here. For some weird reason, `flex` does not work correctly. See [below](#weird-layout-render).

## React Navigation

[`react-navigation`](https://reactnavigation.org)

### Navigation Crash

On IOS, navigating to a screen from within the Sheet can cause issues. To resolve this, dismiss the sheet before navigating!

Example:
```tsx {4-5}
const sheet = useRef<TrueSheet>(null)

const navigate = async () => {
  await sheet.current?.dismiss() // wait for the sheet to dismiss ✅
  navigation.navigate('SomeScreen') // navigate to the screen 🎉
}

return (
  <TrueSheet ref={sheet}>
    <Button onPress={navigate} title="Navigate to SomeScreen" />
    <View />
  </TrueSheet>
)
```

### Present during Mount

On iOS, when setting [`initialDetentIndex`](/reference/props#initialdetentindex) and enabling `initialDetentAnimated` (default is `true`) to present during mount, the presentation animation becomes weird. This happens because RNN is not yet finished when the sheet is trying to present.

To solve this, you can do the following:

1. Set `initialDetentAnimated` to `false`. Disables animation during mount.

```tsx
return (
  <TrueSheet initialDetentIndex={0} initialDetentAnimated={false}>
    <View />
  </TrueSheet>
)
```

2. Wait for the screen to fully transition. See [`transitionEnd`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/native-stack-navigator/#transitionend) event.

```tsx
const navigation = useNavigation()
const [isScreenShown, setIsScreenShown] = useState(false)

// Subscribe to the transitionEnd event ✅
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = navigation.addListener("transitionEnd", ({ data }) => {
    if (!data.closing) {
      setIsScreenShown(true)
    }
  })

  return unsubscribe
}, [])

// Wait for the screen to finish transitioning ✅
if (!isScreenShown) return null

// Finally show the sheet 🎉
return (
  <TrueSheet initialDetentIndex={0} initialDetentAnimated>
    <View />
  </TrueSheet>
)
```

## Weird layout render

The sheet does not have control over how React Native renders components and may lead to rendering issues. To resolve this, try to minimize the use of `flex=1` in your content styles. Instead, use fixed `height` or employ `flexGrow`, `flexBasis`, etc., to manage your layout requirements.
