title: Floating Footer
---

Do you need an FAB (Floating Action Button) on the sheet? Or perhaps a small banner at the bottom? We've got you covered!

`TrueSheet` provides first-class support for a `Footer` component. This component will float at the bottom of the sheet.

## How?

Define your footer component.

```tsx
const SomeFooter = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>My Foot-er is Awesome.</Text>
    </View>
  )
}
```

Stick it in the [`FooterComponent`](/reference/props#footercomponent).

```tsx {3}
const App = () => {
  return (
    <TrueSheet FooterComponent={SomeFooter}>
      <View />
    </TrueSheet>
  )
}
```

:::tip
For best performance, use `ReactElement` instead!

```tsx {5-9}
const App = () => {
  return (
    <TrueSheet
      ref={sheet}
      FooterComponent={
        <View>
          <Text>My Foot-er is more awesome.</Text>
        </View>
      }
    >
      <View />
    </TrueSheet>
  )
}
```
