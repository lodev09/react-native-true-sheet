### Using `react-native-gesture-handler` on **Android**

On Android, [RNGH does not work](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/fundamentals/installation/#usage-with-modals-on-android) by default because modals are not located under React Native Root view in native hierarchy. To fix that, components need to be wrapped with `GestureHandlerRootView`.

```tsx
import { GestureHandlerRootView } from 'react-native-gesture-handler'
```

```tsx
return (
  <TrueSheet ref={sheet}>
    <GestureHandlerRootView>
      <View />
    </GestureHandlerRootView>
  </TrueSheet>
)
```

### Integrating `@react-navigation/native` on **IOS**

On IOS, navigating to a [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org) screen from within the Sheet can cause issues. To resolve this, dismiss the sheet before navigating!

Example:
```tsx
const sheet = useRef<TrueSheet>(null)

const navigate = async () => {
  await sheet.current?.dismiss() // wait for the sheet to dismiss âœ…
  navigation.navigate('SomeScreen') // navigate to the screen ðŸŽ‰
}

return (
  <TrueSheet ref={sheet}>
    <Button onPress={navigate} title="Navigate to SomeScreen" />
    <View />
  </TrueSheet>
)
```

### Weird layout render

The sheet does not have control over how React Native renders components and may lead to rendering issues. To resolve this, try to minimize the use of `flex=1` in your content styles. Instead, use fixed `height` or employ `flexGrow`, `flexBasis`, etc., to manage your layout requirements.
