title: Global Methods
description: Methods that you can access anywhere in your App!

`TrueSheet` relies heavily on [`ref` methods](/reference/methods) to present and dismiss the sheet. However, this becomes challenging when the button is deep within the component tree.

To resolve this issue, `TrueSheet` provides [global methods](/reference/methods#global-methods) that allow you to present or dismiss any sheet from anywhere!

## How?

Somewhere in your App, define the sheet with a [`name`](/reference/props#name).

```tsx {3}
const App = () => {
  return (
    <TrueSheet name="my-sheet">
      <View />
    </TrueSheet>
  )
}
```

In your component, present the sheet using the `present` global method.

```tsx {5}
import { TrueSheet } from '@lodev09/react-native-true-sheet'

const SomeComponent = () => {
  const presentMySheet = () => {
    TrueSheet.present('my-sheet') // 🎉
  }

  return (
    <Button onPress={presentMySheet} title="Present My Sheet" />
  )
}
```

Guess what? You can also `dismiss` it globally 🤩.

```tsx
TrueSheet.dismiss('my-sheet') // ✅
```
