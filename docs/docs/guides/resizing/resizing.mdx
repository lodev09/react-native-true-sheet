import resizing from './resizing.gif'

`TrueSheet` has a main prop called [`sizes`](/reference/props#sizes) which allows you to define the sizes that the sheet can support. This is an array of [`SheetSize`](/reference/types#sheetsize) that supports sizes like `"auto"`, `"medium"`, `"large"`, etc.

In some cases, you may want to resize the sheet programmatically for a better experience.

<img alt="resizing" src={resizing} width="300"/>

## How?

### Resize Programmatically

Define the sheet and use the [`resize`](/reference/methods#resize) method.

```tsx {2-2,6-6,11-13}
const App = () => {
  const sheet = useRef<TrueSheet>(null)

  const resize = async () => {
    // Resize to 69%
    await sheet.current?.resize(1)
    console.log('Yay, we are now at 69% ðŸ’¦')
  }

  return (
    <TrueSheet name="resizing-sheet" ref={sheet} sizes={['auto', '69%', 'large']}>
      <Button onPress={resize} title="Resize" />
    </TrueSheet>
  )
}
```

:::tip
You can also do it globally using the related [global method](/reference/methods#global-methods).

```tsx
TrueSheet.resize('resizing-sheet', 1)
```
:::

:::info
`sizes` can only support up to 3 sizes. **_collapsed_**, **_half-expanded_**, and **_expanded_**.
:::


### Listening to Size Change

For some reason, if you want to get the resolved size, you can listen to size changes by providing the [`onSizeChange`](/reference/props#onsizechange) event.

The event comes with the [`SizeInfo`](/reference/types#sizeinfo) that you can use to get the size `value`.

```tsx {9-11,17-17}
const App = () => {
  const sheet = useRef<TrueSheet>(null)

  const resize = async () => {
    // Resize to 69%
    await sheet.current?.resize(1)
  }

  const handleSizeChange = (sizeInfo: SizeInfo) => {
    console.log(sizeInfo.index, sizeInfo.value) // Do whatever you need from this size âœ…
  }

  return (
    <TrueSheet
      ref={sheet}
      sizes={['auto', '69%', 'large']}
      onSizeChange={handleSizeChange}
    >
      <Button onPress={resize} title="Resize" />
    </TrueSheet>
  )
}
```

:::info
The event will also trigger when the user drags the sheet into a size.
