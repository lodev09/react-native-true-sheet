import onmount from './onmount.gif'

Sometimes, you may want to present the sheet directly during mount. For example, you might want to present the sheet when a screen is opened through a deep link.

<img alt="onmount" src={onmount} width="300"/>

## How?

You can do this by setting [`initialIndex`](/reference/props#initialindex) prop. It accepts the [`size`](/reference/types#sheetsize) `index` that your sheet is configured with. See [sizes](/reference/props#sizes) prop for more information.

```tsx {5-6}
const App = () => {
  return (
    <TrueSheet
      sizes={['auto', '69%', 'large']}
      initialIndex={1}
      initialIndexAnimated
    >
      <View />
    </TrueSheet>
  )
}
```

### Disabling Animation

You may want to disable the present animation. To do this, simply set [`initialIndexAnimated`](/reference/props#initialindexanimated) to `false`.

### Using with React Navigation

Using this with [`react-navigation`](https://reactnavigation.org) can cause render issue. Check out the [troubleshooting guide](/troubleshooting#present-during-mount) for the fix 😉.
