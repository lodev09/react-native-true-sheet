import onmount from './onmount.gif'

Sometimes, you may want to present the sheet directly during mount. For example, you might want to present the sheet when a screen is opened through a deep link.

<img alt="onmount" src={onmount} width="300"/>

## How?

You can do this by setting [`initialDetentIndex`](/reference/props#initialdetentindex) prop. It accepts the [`detent`](/reference/types#sheetdetent) `index` that your sheet is configured with. See [detents](/reference/props#detents) prop for more information.

```tsx {5-6}
const App = () => {
  return (
    <TrueSheet
      detents={['auto', 0.69, 1]}
      initialDetentIndex={1}
      initialDetentAnimated
    >
      <View />
    </TrueSheet>
  )
}
```

### Disabling Animation

You may want to disable the present animation. To do this, simply set [`initialDetentAnimated`](/reference/props#initialdetentanimated) to `false`.

### Using with React Navigation

Using this with [`react-navigation`](https://reactnavigation.org) can cause render issue. Check out the [troubleshooting guide](/troubleshooting#present-during-mount) for the fix 😉.
