Yes! TrueSheet does support [`edge-to-edge`](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/edge-to-edge).

## How?

It's easy, just set [`edgeToEdge`](/reference/props#edgetoedge) to `true`.

```tsx {3}
const App = () => {
  return (
    <TrueSheet edgeToEdge={true}>
      <View />
    </TrueSheet>
  )
}
```
