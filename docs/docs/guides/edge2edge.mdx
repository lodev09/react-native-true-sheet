Yes! TrueSheet fully supports [`edge-to-edge`](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/edge-to-edge) display on Android.

## How it works

TrueSheet **automatically detects** if your app has edge-to-edge enabled and adapts accordingly. There's no need to configure anything – it just works!

When you enable edge-to-edge in your app (at the Activity level), TrueSheet will:
- Automatically extend the sheet content under the system bars
- Handle window insets properly
- Adjust layout calculations to account for system bars

## Enabling edge-to-edge in your app

To enable edge-to-edge for your entire React Native app, follow [React Native's edge-to-edge documentation](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/08/12/release-0.75#edge-to-edge-by-default-on-android-15-sdk-35).

Alternatively, you can use [`react-native-edge-to-edge`](https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-edge-to-edge) – a cool tiny package that makes it effortless to enable edge-to-edge display for your app.

Once edge-to-edge is enabled in your app, TrueSheet will automatically detect and adapt to it.

## Note

Edge-to-edge is enforced by default for apps targeting Android SDK 35 (Android 15) and above. TrueSheet is fully compatible with this requirement.
