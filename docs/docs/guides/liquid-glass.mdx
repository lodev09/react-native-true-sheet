Starting with iOS 26, Apple introduced the **Liquid Glass** visual effect, a new design element that creates a frosted glass appearance on sheets and modals.

TrueSheet **supports Liquid Glass by default** on iOS 26+, giving your sheets a modern, native look.

<img alt="liquid-glass" src={glass} width="300"/>

## What is Liquid Glass?

Liquid Glass is a visual effect introduced in iOS 26 that provides a translucent, frosted glass appearance with a subtle blur. It's part of Apple's latest design language and is automatically applied to native sheet presentations.

By default, TrueSheet enables Liquid Glass on iOS 26+ devices when no [`backgroundColor`](/reference/configuration#backgroundcolor) or [`backgroundBlur`](/reference/configuration#backgroundblur) is provided. The sheet will automatically display with the Liquid Glass effect.

## Disabling Liquid Glass

If you prefer the classic sheet appearance without Liquid Glass, there are two options:

### Using `backgroundColor` or `backgroundBlur`

Setting [`backgroundColor`](/reference/configuration#backgroundcolor) or [`backgroundBlur`](/reference/configuration#backgroundblur) (or both) on the sheet will disable the Liquid Glass effect for that specific sheet.

```tsx
<TrueSheet backgroundColor="#ffffff">
  {/* Sheet content */}
</TrueSheet>
```

```tsx
<TrueSheet backgroundBlur="system-material">
  {/* Sheet content */}
</TrueSheet>
```

This approach allows you to disable Liquid Glass on a per-sheet basis while keeping it enabled for other sheets in your app.

:::note
This only works on iOS 26.1 and above.

### Using `UIDesignRequiresCompatibility`

Set `UIDesignRequiresCompatibility` to `true` in your `Info.plist` to disable Liquid Glass.

#### Using Info.plist

Add the following key to your `ios/YourApp/Info.plist`:

```xml title="ios/YourApp/Info.plist"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <!-- Other keys... -->
  <key>UIDesignRequiresCompatibility</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

#### Using Expo Config Plugin

If you're using Expo, you can configure this through your `app.json` or `app.config.js`:

```js title="app.config.js"
export default {
  expo: {
    ios: {
      infoPlist: {
        UIDesignRequiresCompatibility: true,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

After making this change, rebuild your app:

```sh
npx expo prebuild --clean
npx expo run:ios
```

:::note
This setting disables the Liquid Glass UI across your entire app, not just for sheets. See [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Information-Property-List/UIDesignRequiresCompatibility) for more details.
