Scrolling content within the sheet requires some special configuration on both iOS and Android. Let's admit, some things just don't work out of the box.

Follow the guide below so you can scroll your content using `TrueSheet`.

## How?

### IOS

On iOS, use [`scrollRef`](/reference/props#scrollref) to reference the scrollable component, allowing iOS to handle it automatically.

This works for `FlatList` as well.

```tsx {6-7}
const App = () => {
  const sheet = useRef<TrueSheet>(null)
  const scrollview = useRef<ScrollView>(null)

  return (
    <TrueSheet ref={sheet} scrollRef={scrollview}>
      <ScrollView ref={scrollview} nestedScrollEnabled>
        <View />
      </ScrollView>
    </TrueSheet>
  )
}
```

### Android

On Android, `nestedScrollEnabled` needs to be enabled so that scrolling works when the sheet is expanded to its `maxHeight`.

```tsx {6}
const App = () => {
  const sheet = useRef<TrueSheet>(null)

  return (
    <TrueSheet ref={sheet}>
      <ScrollView nestedScrollEnabled>
        <View />
      </ScrollView>
    </TrueSheet>
  )
}
```

:::caution
If your `ScrollView` content height is smaller than the sheet height, scrolling may not work properly due to a React Native framework limitation. This is because the `ScrollView` won't be scrollable when there's no overflow.

**Workaround:** Ensure your content height exceeds the sheet height, or use a `FlatList` with a minimum number of items.
