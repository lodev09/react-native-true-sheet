:::note
Navigating from within the sheet requires changes to `react-native-screens`. There is a [pending PR](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/pull/3415) that adds support for this. In the meantime, you can apply the patch from the [example app](https://github.com/lodev09/react-native-true-sheet/blob/main/.yarn/patches/react-native-screens-npm-4.18.0-fa7de65975.patch).
:::

You can navigate to other screens from within a sheet without any issues! The sheet will remain visible in the background when presenting modals on top.

<img alt="navigation" src={navigation} width="300"/>

## How?

Just do it like you would normally 😉

```tsx
const sheet = useRef<TrueSheet>(null)

const navigate = () => {
  // Navigate directly - no need to dismiss first! ✅
  navigation.navigate('SomeScreen')
}

return (
  <TrueSheet ref={sheet}>
    <Button onPress={navigate} title="Navigate to SomeScreen" />
    <View />
  </TrueSheet>
)
```

## Focus and Blur Events

When presenting `react-native-screens` modals on top of the sheet, focus and blur events are emitted automatically. This allows you to respond when the sheet loses or regains focus due to modal presentation/dismissal.

```tsx
<TrueSheet
  ref={sheet}
  onWillBlur={() => {
    // Modal is about to be presented on top
    console.log('Sheet will lose focus')
  }}
  onDidBlur={() => {
    // Modal is now presented on top
    console.log('Sheet lost focus')
  }}
  onWillFocus={() => {
    // Modal is about to be dismissed
    console.log('Sheet will regain focus')
  }}
  onDidFocus={() => {
    // Modal was dismissed, sheet is back in focus
    console.log('Sheet regained focus')
  }}
>
  <Button onPress={() => navigation.navigate('ModalScreen')} title="Open Modal" />
</TrueSheet>
```

:::tip
Use `onDidFocus` to refresh data or re-enable interactions when returning from a modal.

## Dismissing Before Navigation

If you prefer to dismiss the sheet before navigating for UX reasons, you can still do so:

```tsx
const navigate = async () => {
  await sheet.current?.dismiss()
  navigation.navigate('SomeScreen')
}
```

## Presenting on Screen Focus

When presenting a sheet in response to screen focus (e.g., using `useFocusEffect`), you may encounter issues on iOS where the sheet presents on the wrong view controller. This happens when a modal is being dismissed and the focus event fires before iOS marks the modal as "being dismissed".

### Solution: Delay with requestAnimationFrame

Use `requestAnimationFrame` to delay the presentation, giving iOS time to update the view controller state:

```tsx
import { useFocusEffect } from '@react-navigation/native'

const sheet = useRef<TrueSheet>(null)

useFocusEffect(
  useCallback(() => {
    // Delay presentation to ensure dismissing modals are detected ✅
    requestAnimationFrame(() => {
      sheet.current?.present()
    })
  }, [])
)

return (
  <TrueSheet ref={sheet}>
    <View />
  </TrueSheet>
)
```

## Present During Mount

When setting [`initialDetentIndex`](/reference/configuration#initialdetentindex) and enabling `initialDetentAnimated` (default is `true`) to present during mount, the presentation animation may behave unexpectedly on iOS. This happens because React Navigation is not yet finished transitioning when the sheet tries to present.

### Solution 1: Disable Animation

Set `initialDetentAnimated` to `false` to disable animation during mount:

```tsx
return (
  <TrueSheet initialDetentIndex={0} initialDetentAnimated={false}>
    <View />
  </TrueSheet>
)
```

### Solution 2: Wait for Screen Transition

Wait for the screen to fully transition using the [`transitionEnd`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/native-stack-navigator/#transitionend) event:

```tsx
const navigation = useNavigation()
const [isScreenShown, setIsScreenShown] = useState(false)

// Subscribe to the transitionEnd event ✅
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = navigation.addListener("transitionEnd", ({ data }) => {
    if (!data.closing) {
      setIsScreenShown(true)
    }
  })

  return unsubscribe
}, [])

// Wait for the screen to finish transitioning ✅
if (!isScreenShown) return null

// Finally show the sheet 🎉
return (
  <TrueSheet initialDetentIndex={0} initialDetentAnimated>
    <View />
  </TrueSheet>
)
```
