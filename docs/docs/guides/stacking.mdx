TrueSheet automatically handles stacking when you present a sheet while another is already visible. The currently visible sheet will be hidden, and when the new sheet is dismissed, the previous sheet will be shown again.

<img alt="stacking" src={stacking} width="300"/>

## How?

Simply present a new sheet while another is visible. The sheets don't need to be in a parent-child relationship - they can be defined anywhere in your component tree.

```tsx
const presentSheet2 = async () => {
  await sheet2.current?.present() // Sheet 2 will present, Sheet 1 will be hidden
}

return (
  <>
    <TrueSheet ref={sheet1}>
      <Button onPress={presentSheet2} title="Present Sheet 2" />
      <View />
    </TrueSheet>
    <TrueSheet ref={sheet2}>
      <View />
    </TrueSheet>
  </>
)
```

When Sheet 2 is dismissed, Sheet 1 will automatically be shown again.

:::note
The previous sheet is only hidden if it's not fully expanded. When expanded, the new sheet simply presents on top.

## Dismissing Stacked Sheets

When you have stacked sheets, calling `dismiss()` on a sheet that has other sheets presented on top of it will dismiss all sheets above it, but the sheet itself will remain presented. This matches iOS's native `UIViewController` behavior.

```tsx
// If Sheet 1 → Sheet 2 → Sheet 3 (Sheet 1 presented Sheet 2, Sheet 2 presented Sheet 3)

await sheet1.current?.dismiss() // Dismisses Sheet 2 and Sheet 3, Sheet 1 stays
await sheet2.current?.dismiss() // Dismisses Sheet 3, Sheet 1 and Sheet 2 stay
await sheet3.current?.dismiss() // Dismisses Sheet 3, Sheet 1 and Sheet 2 stay
```

This is useful when you need to dismiss all child sheets and return focus to a parent sheet without closing it.

## Stack Behavior (Web)

On web, you can customize the stacking behavior using the [`stackBehavior`](https://gorhom.dev/react-native-bottom-sheet/modal/props#stackbehavior) prop:

```tsx
<TrueSheet stackBehavior="push">
  <View />
</TrueSheet>
```

| Value | Description |
| - | - |
| `"push"` | Mount the modal on top of the current one. |
| `"switch"` | Minimize the current modal then mount the new one. **(default)** |
| `"replace"` | Dismiss the current modal then mount the new one. |

## Focus Events

When stacking sheets, you can listen to focus events to know when a sheet gains or loses focus:

- **`onDidBlur`** - Called when the sheet loses focus because another sheet is presented on top
- **`onDidFocus`** - Called when the sheet regains focus after a sheet on top is dismissed

This is useful for pausing/resuming updates, refreshing data, or managing interactions when the sheet is not the topmost.

```tsx {7-8}
const handleFocus = () => {
  console.log('Sheet regained focus - refresh data')
}

const handleBlur = () => {
  console.log('Sheet lost focus - pause updates')
}

return (
  <TrueSheet
    ref={sheet1}
    onDidFocus={handleFocus}
    onDidBlur={handleBlur}
  >
    <Button onPress={() => sheet2.current?.present()} title="Present Sheet 2" />
    <TrueSheet ref={sheet2}>
      <View />
    </TrueSheet>
  </TrueSheet>
)
```
