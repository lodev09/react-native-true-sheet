# Edge-to-Edge Display (Android)

TrueSheet automatically detects and adapts to Android's edge-to-edge display mode, providing a modern, immersive experience.

## Enabling Edge-to-Edge

Edge-to-edge is supported in React Native 0.81+ via the `edgeToEdgeEnabled` Gradle property.

Enable it in your `android/gradle.properties`:

```gradle title="android/gradle.properties"
edgeToEdgeEnabled=true
```

:::info
This property is **disabled by default** for current Android versions. TrueSheet will auto-detect when you enable it.

Starting with **Android 16+ (API level 36)**, edge-to-edge will be [automatically enabled by default](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/behavior-changes-16#edge-to-edge) by the system.

## Default Behavior

By default, when edge-to-edge is enabled, the sheet respects the status bar and stops at the bottom of it when fully expanded. This ensures content remains visible and not obscured by the status bar.

```tsx
<TrueSheet ref={sheet}>
  <View />
</TrueSheet>
```

## Full Screen Mode

If you want the sheet to extend behind the status bar for a true full-screen experience, use the `edgeToEdgeFullScreen` prop:

```tsx {2}
<TrueSheet
  edgeToEdgeFullScreen
  ref={sheet}
>
  <View />
</TrueSheet>
```

When `edgeToEdgeFullScreen` is enabled:
- ✅ The sheet extends behind the status bar when fully expanded
- ✅ The footer (if present) still respects the status bar to prevent overlap

:::tip
Use `edgeToEdgeFullScreen` when you want maximum screen real estate, such as for image galleries or immersive content.

## Summary

| Prop | Behavior |
| - | - |
| Default (no prop) | Sheet stops at status bar bottom |
| `edgeToEdgeFullScreen` | Sheet extends behind status bar |

Both modes work seamlessly with edge-to-edge enabled and provide automatic status bar detection.
