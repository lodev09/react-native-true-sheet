TrueSheet automatically detects and adapts to Android's edge-to-edge display mode.

## How?

Edge-to-edge is supported in React Native 0.81+ via the `edgeToEdgeEnabled` Gradle property.

Enable it in your `android/gradle.properties`:

```gradle title="android/gradle.properties"
edgeToEdgeEnabled=true
```

:::info
This property is **disabled by default**. TrueSheet will auto-detect when you enable it.

## What Happens?

When edge-to-edge is enabled, TrueSheet:
- Positions the sheet above the navigation bar
- Adjusts height calculations for system bars
- Handles keyboard interactions properly

No configuration needed on your end - it just works!
