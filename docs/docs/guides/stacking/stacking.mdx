Sometimes you want to stack the sheets one after another. There are _**two**_ ways to do this.

<img alt="stacking" src={stacking} width="300"/>

## How?

### 1. Dismiss the "parent" sheet first

```tsx {2-3,9-9}
const presentSheet2 = async () => {
  await sheet1.current?.dismiss() // Wait for sheet 1 to dismiss
  await sheet2.current?.present() // Sheet 2 will now present
}

return (
  <>
    <TrueSheet ref={sheet1}>
      <Button onPress={presentSheet2} title="Present Sheet 2" />
      <View />
    </TrueSheet>
    <TrueSheet ref={sheet2}>
      <View />
    </TrueSheet>
  </>
)
```
### 2. Define the 2nd sheet within the "parent" sheet.

Both iOS and Android handle this automatically. When a nested sheet presents, the parent sheet is hidden. When the nested sheet dismisses, the parent sheet is shown again.

```tsx {2-2,7-7}
const presentSheet2 = async () => {
  await sheet2.current?.present() // Sheet 2 will now present
}

return (
  <TrueSheet ref={sheet1}>
    <Button onPress={presentSheet2} title="Present Sheet 2" />
    <TrueSheet ref={sheet2}>
      <View />
    </TrueSheet>
  </TrueSheet>
)
```

:::note
On Android, the parent sheet is only hidden if it's not fully expanded. This is to be consistent with iOS, which does not hide the parent sheet when stacked.
