One of the most common use cases for a Bottom Sheet is to present it while still allowing users to interact with background components, such as in a Maps app.

In this guide, you can configure `TrueSheet` to achieve this exact functionality.

<img alt="dimming" src={dimming} width="300"/>

## How?

You can easily disable the dimmed background of the sheet by setting [`dimmed`](/reference/props#dimmed) to `false`.

```tsx {5}
export const App = () => {
  return (
    <TrueSheet
      sizes={['auto', '69%', 'large']}
      dimmed={false}
    >
      <View />
    </TrueSheet>
  )
}
```

### Dimmed by Size Index

To further customize the dimming behavior, [`dimmedIndex`](/reference/props#dimmedindex) is also available. Set the [size](/reference/props#sizes) `index` at which you want the sheet to start dimming.

```tsx {5}
export const App = () => {
  return (
    <TrueSheet
      sizes={['auto', '69%', 'large']}
      dimmedIndex={1} // Dim will start at 69% âœ…
    >
      <View />
    </TrueSheet>
  )
}
```

:::info
`dimmedIndex` is ignored if `dimmed` is set to `false`.
