## True Sheet 3.0 is here!

We're thrilled to announce the biggest update yet! True Sheet has been **completely rebuilt from the ground up** for React Native's New Architecture (Fabric). This isn't just an update — it's a whole new level of performance and native experience.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '16px', marginBottom: '24px' }}>
  <img alt="React Native True Sheet - iOS" src={previewIos} width="300" />
  <img alt="React Native True Sheet - Android" src={previewAndroid} width="300" />
</div>

{/* truncate */}

## Powered by Fabric

Version 3 is built **exclusively** for React Native's New Architecture. Here's what that means for you:

- **No Bridge** — Direct C++ communication between JavaScript and native code
- **Blazing Fast** — Synchronous layout updates with Fabric
- **Shared C++ Core** — State and shadow nodes shared between iOS and Android
- **100% Type-safe** — Full TypeScript support with Codegen-generated native interfaces

**Requirements:**
- React Native >= 0.76 (Expo SDK 52+)
- New Architecture enabled (default in RN 0.76+)

## What's New

### Automatic ScrollView Detection

Say goodbye to `scrollRef`! Scroll views are now **automatically detected** on iOS. Just use the `scrollable` prop and you're good to go:

```tsx
<TrueSheet scrollable>
  <ScrollView>{/* Your scrollable content */}</ScrollView>
</TrueSheet>
```

See the [Scrolling guide](/guides/scrolling) for more details.

### Native Header and Footer

Add fixed headers and footers that stay put while your content scrolls:

```tsx
<TrueSheet
  header={<MyHeader />}
  footer={<MyFooter />}
>
  <FlatList data={items} renderItem={renderItem} />
</TrueSheet>
```

See the [Header guide](/guides/header) and [Footer guide](/guides/footer) for more details.

### Sheet Stacking

Stack multiple sheets on top of each other on **both iOS and Android**! New focus events help you manage interactions:

- **`onWillFocus`** / **`onDidFocus`** — Sheet regains focus
- **`onWillBlur`** / **`onDidBlur`** — Sheet loses focus

See the [Stacking guide](/guides/stacking) for more details.

### Rich Event System

Track every moment of your sheet's lifecycle:

| Lifecycle | Drag | Position |
| - | - | - |
| `onMount` | `onDragBegin` | `onPositionChange` |
| `onWillPresent` | `onDragChange` | `onDetentChange` |
| `onDidPresent` | `onDragEnd` | |
| `onWillDismiss` | | |
| `onDidDismiss` | | |

See the [onMount guide](/guides/onmount) for handling sheet readiness.

### Reanimated v4 Integration

Seamless animations with dedicated Reanimated components:

```tsx
import {
  ReanimatedTrueSheetProvider,
  ReanimatedTrueSheet,
  useReanimatedTrueSheet,
} from '@lodev09/react-native-true-sheet/reanimated'
import Animated, { useAnimatedStyle, interpolate } from 'react-native-reanimated'

const App = () => (
  <ReanimatedTrueSheetProvider>
    <MySheet />
  </ReanimatedTrueSheetProvider>
)

const MySheet = () => (
  <ReanimatedTrueSheet detents={[0.3, 0.6, 1]}>
    <AnimatedContent />
  </ReanimatedTrueSheet>
)

const AnimatedContent = () => {
  const { animatedIndex } = useReanimatedTrueSheet()

  // Fade in as sheet expands from index 0 to 1
  const animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
    opacity: interpolate(animatedIndex.value, [0, 1], [0, 1])
  }))

  return (
    <Animated.View style={animatedStyle}>
      <Text>I fade in as the sheet expands!</Text>
    </Animated.View>
  )
}
```

See the [Reanimated guide](/guides/reanimated) for complete examples.

### Draggable Control

Need a static sheet? Disable dragging entirely:

```tsx
<TrueSheet draggable={false} detents={[0.5, 1]}>
  <Button title="Expand" onPress={() => sheet.current?.resize(1)} />
</TrueSheet>
```

See the [Resizing guide](/guides/resizing) for programmatic control.

### Dimming Control

Customize when the background dims based on detent index:

```tsx
<TrueSheet detents={[0.3, 0.6, 1]} dimmedDetentIndex={1}>
  {/* Dims only when at index 1 or above */}
</TrueSheet>
```

See the [Dimming guide](/guides/dimming) for more details.

### Edge-to-Edge Support (Android)

TrueSheet automatically adapts to Android's edge-to-edge mode. Go full-screen with:

```tsx
<TrueSheet edgeToEdgeFullScreen />
```

See the [Edge-to-Edge guide](/guides/edge-to-edge) for details.

### Global Static Methods

Present sheets from anywhere in your app using static methods:

```tsx
// Register a named sheet
<TrueSheet name="my-sheet">
  {/* content */}
</TrueSheet>

// Present from anywhere
TrueSheet.present('my-sheet')
```

See the [Global Methods guide](/guides/global-methods) for more details.

### React Native Screens Integration

Navigate to other screens from within a sheet without any issues! The sheet will remain visible in the background when presenting modals on top.

:::note
This requires changes to `react-native-screens`. There is a [pending PR](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/pull/3415) that adds support for this. In the meantime, you can apply the patch from the [example app](https://github.com/lodev09/react-native-true-sheet/blob/main/.yarn/patches/react-native-screens-npm-4.18.0-fa7de65975.patch).

See the [React Navigation guide](/guides/navigation) for more details.

## Breaking Changes

Heads up! Version 3 includes some breaking changes:

- **Fabric Required** — Old Paper architecture is no longer supported
- **Prop Renames** — `sizes` → `detents`, `initialIndex` → `initialDetentIndex`, `onPresent` → `onDidPresent`, and more
- **Detent Values** — Use fractional values (`0.5`) instead of percentage strings (`"50%"`)
- **Removed Props** — `scrollRef`, `grabberProps`, `contentContainerStyle`

Check out the [Migration Guide](/migration) for the full list and step-by-step upgrade instructions.
