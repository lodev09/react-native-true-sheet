## Sheet is getting good on Android! 🤖

Version 3.4 brings two major upgrades to the Android experience: silky-smooth dimming and natural sheet stacking — now consistent with iOS! ✨

## 🌑 Smooth Dimming

Say goodbye to clunky window dim! True Sheet now uses a **custom dim view** with real-time interpolation. As you drag the sheet, the dim smoothly fades in and out based on position.

The `dimmedDetentIndex` prop feels alive — drag past the threshold and watch the background dim; drag back down and it fades away. Buttery smooth. 🧈

Learn more in the [Dimming guide](/guides/dimming).

## 📚 Natural Sheet Stacking

When you present a sheet on top of another, the parent now **slides down** instead of disappearing. This creates a beautiful stacking effect that feels right at home on Android.

Resize the child sheet? The parent follows along in real-time to maintain that perfect visual hierarchy. 🎯
