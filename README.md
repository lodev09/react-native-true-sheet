## Usage

```tsx
import { TrueSheet } from "@lodev09/react-native-true-sheet"

export const App = () => {
  const sheet = useRef<TrueSheet>(null)

  // Present the sheet ✅
  const present = async () => {
    await sheet.current?.present()
    console.log('horray! sheet has been presented 💩')
  }

  // Dismiss the sheet ✅
  const dismiss = async () => {
    await sheet.current?.dismiss()
    console.log('Bye bye 👋')
  }

  return (
    <View>
      <Button onPress={present} title="Present" />
      <TrueSheet
        ref={sheet}
        detents={['auto', 1]}
      >
        <Button onPress={dismiss} title="Dismiss" />
      </TrueSheet>
    </View>
  )
}
```

## Testing

TrueSheet includes built-in Jest mocks for easy testing. Simply mock the package in your tests:

```tsx
jest.mock('@lodev09/react-native-true-sheet');
```

All methods (`present`, `dismiss`, `resize`) are mocked as Jest functions, allowing you to test your components without native dependencies.
